## Description

This is a capstone project course for Seniors in the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Digital Arts & Technology (DAT) track. Students will work in various capacities to define projects that meet the criteria for Senior Projects and take on assigned roles that meet their educational goals developed for the semester. Projects may have been started/conceived in MART 416 - Production Studio 1 or be brand new to the student this term.

The primary goal for this course is for students to conceive of, develop, finish, and present a senior project, representative of their BFA experience, and useful to their future career ambitions. 

## Objectives & Student Learning Outcomes

- Define a personal trajectory, including; goals and research. This should serve to prepare students for the next steps beyond the undergraduate experience. 
- Create compelling content.
- Develop a more thorough understanding of the field, its history, and contemporary issues.
- Create media products that meet the needs of designers, clients and users.
- Provide an environment for students to design and evaluate their own creative work and the work of others. This course places a strong emphasis on the production of large-scale works. These projects may be completed with a group or as an individual.

Furthermore, students will demonstrate understanding of the following principles and techniques through studio projects:

- Digital design concepts and terminology
- Digital creative/art concepts and terminology
- Intermediate to advanced coding and programming languages
- Interactive technologies and their counterparts
- Project pitching/storyboards
- Project development

## Course Websites

There will be a Moodle shell for this course. In this shell will be the syllabus, as well as specific requirements for your projects. Additionally, you will submit links of all assignments there. 


## Pre-Requisites

There are no specific pre-req's for this course. However, this course will build on the theory, technical skills, and concepts explored in all of the courses you have taken previously. It is also assumed that you are taking this course in the final year of your BFA experience. You are expected to utilize your previous expertise in coding, content creation, story telling, art, sculpture, sound, music, dance, etc. towards the projects presented in the course.


## Books and Supplies

There are no required texts that you must purchase for this course. When possible, the department will attempt to supply you with tools and equipment that we have access to. Please leverage departmental resources whenever necessary.

This course may require minimal financial investments in materials from you. These will be dictated by the projects you choose to pursue. I will work to keep these to a minimum, and to utilize departmental/institutional resources when possible.


# Policies

## Course Evaluation

Student work and progress will be assessed through;

- The Project
	- Iteration and development of your project, such that you can clearly articulate and end goal for your project, as well as how it will be completed during the course of this semester.
	- Clear articulation, in writing, with your collaborators (where applicable), between your work and the narrative arc of the project of which you are involved. 
	- Your ability to meet deadlines throughout the course of the semester.

## Plagiarism and Cheating Policy

Students are expected to adhere to academic conduct policies of the University of Montana as explained in Section V of your [University of Montana Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/Student%20Conduct%20Code%20-%20FINAL%20-%208-24-18.pdf):  “Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  Academic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:  (1) plagiarism, (2) misconduct during an examination or academic exercise, (3) unauthorized possession of examination or other course materials, (4) tampering with course materials, (5) submitting false information, (6) submitting work previously presented in another course, (7) improperly influencing conduct, (8) substituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise, (9) facilitating academic dishonesty, and (10) Altering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents.”

Dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating on tests, cheating on assignments, fabricating information or citations, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of other students.

Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another without acknowledgement. As defined by the [University of Montana’s Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/default.php), plagiarism is “Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or materials as one's own.”  Students may use information and ideas expressed by others, but this use must be identified by appropriate referencing.

Students who cheat or plagiarize will receive academic sanctions, which may include an “F” grade on the assignment, examination, and/or in the course. Students will also be reported to the Dean of Students for possible further disciplinary action.

#### Using Code or Media Found Elsewhere

It is easy to find code and media (i.e. videos, sounds, images, etc.) online. If you use code or media from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to cite the work and author.

If you use found code, you are expected to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. _Do not_ summarize several lines of code from a high level (i.e., TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition, in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It is bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It is not a copy and paste job. Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

If you use found media, *YOU* are responsible to ensure it is used according to fair-use guidelines. The pieces you make in this course are intended to be portfolio-quality works. Therefore, you should not utilize found media with restrictive use guidelines or licenses. You can read more about various licenses at;

- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com)

- [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
- [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses)

For found media, you are also expected to cite the media in your documentation for the project.



## Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction through collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. Students with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead and can contact [Disability Services for Students (DSS)](http://www.umt.edu/dss/). If you think you may have a disability adversely affecting your academic performance, and you have not already registered with Disability Services, please contact Disability Services in Lommasson Center 154, or call (406)243-2243. I will work with you and Disability Services to provide an appropriate modification.




## Changes to the Course

I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
